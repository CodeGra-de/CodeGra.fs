CodeGrade Filesystem
======================================

The CodeGrade Filesystem is the extension of CodeGrade that allows you to
test, review and grade all CodeGrade assignments locally from within your
favourite editor. The Filesystem application mounts a local CodeGrade instance
on your computer, which makes browsing through all your CodeGrade courses,
assignments and submissions very easy.

We aim to further enhance the grading experience and decrease overhead with the
CodeGrade Filesystem.

The code of the CodeGrade Filesystem is open-source and can be found on
`Github <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.fs>`__.
