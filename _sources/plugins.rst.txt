Editor Plug-ins
=================

The CodeGrade Filesystem mounts files locally to your system in such a way that
they can be used in any editor or by any tools. Furthermore, the special files
created by the Filesystem can be edited manually in any editor to grade and
review submissions.

For some editors, we have however created plugins to make interacting with the
special files easier and to make it possible to give inline feedback locally
too. This allows the entire grading workflow to be done locally.
