CodeGrade Filesystem
======================================

The CodeGrade Filesystem (or CodeGra.fs) can be used in combination with the web application.
It can mount a local CodeGrade instance on your computer to locally browse submissions and files on the CodeGrade server.
The filesystem can be used for students to locally work on the CodeGrade mount and thus automatically hand in the assignment
with each save. For teachers the filesystem can be used to locally grade work using an editor of choice without any overhead. The Filesystem
is aimed to drastically enhance the grading experience and make it more efficient.
